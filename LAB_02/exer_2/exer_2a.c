/*
Write a C program that copies the contents of a file into a different file (given two filenames
as command line arguments). Take any two sample files and do them. Error-proof your argument: i.e.
detect and print messages when errors occur â€“ for instance, file is not present, unable to read/write, etc.
Also ensure that your program terminates gracefully when errors occur.
